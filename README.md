# Sales Analysis Dashboard


This Power BI project is focused on a detailed **Sales Analysis Dashboard** built using Excel data. It aims to uncover meaningful insights into product performance, sales trends, profit behavior, discount effectiveness, and customer purchasing patterns.

## Project Objectives

The dashboard answers the following key business questions:

1. Top/Bottom 5 products by **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity Sold**.
2. How do sales trends vary over **daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual** timeframes?
3. What is the relationship between **Sales** and **Profit**?
4. Comparison of **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity Sold** between **any two user-selected periods**.
5. Average discount offered in each **discount category**.
6. Total **number of orders** placed.
7. Dynamic filtering of **Sales**, **Profit**, **Discount**, **Net Sales**, and other fields using visual slicers (e.g., **Product**, **Date**, **Customer ID**, **Promotion Categories**).
8. Breakdown of **Sales by different cities**.
